# Global-AI-Patent-Analysis-2020-2020-

The report provides a comprehensive analysis of AI patent innovations worldwide between 2010 and 2020, revealing a remarkable surge in AI patenting activities across multiple industries. Personal devices and computing emerged as the dominant sector, accounting for over 134,000 patents, representing 41% of total AI patents granted, far surpassing other fields such as telecommunications (15%), business, life sciences, and transportation. The United States led globally with 63,432 patents, followed by China and South Korea, while Uruguay recorded the least. AI patent grants grew exponentially by over 1600% from 3,948 in 2010 to a peak of 68,308 in 2019, with a slight decline to 63,328 in 2020, indicating a possible market saturation or strategic consolidation. The report highlights significant innovations in healthcare (AI for diagnostics and drug discovery), automotive (autonomous vehicles and predictive maintenance), finance (fraud detection and algorithmic trading), manufacturing (digital twins and AI-driven quality control), telecommunications (network management and customer support), and agriculture (smart farming and autonomous equipment). Interestingly, while the number of active AI industry fields peaked in 2016 at 450, it declined to 230 by 2020, suggesting a narrowing focus towards commercially viable applications. Overall, the report underscores AIâ€™s transformative impact across industries, with patenting trends reflecting its evolution from nascent research to a strategic driver of global technological innovation.
